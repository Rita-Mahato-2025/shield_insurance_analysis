## 🧾 Project Overview

This project analyzes customer behavior, policy performance, and settlement trends for an insurance company using dimensional modeling and Power BI.
The goal is to help stakeholders understand:

•	Revenue trends
•	Customer growth
•	Sales mode performance
•	Age-group behavior
•	City-level segmentation
•	Settlement patterns

The project follows a clean Ask → Prepare → Process → Analyze → Share lifecycle.

## 🧩 Dataset Description

### The project is based on 5 CSV files:

•	dim_customer.csv – Customer details
•	dim_date.csv – Calendar table
•	dim_policies.csv – Policy information
•	fact_premiums.csv – Policy purchase transactions
•	fact_settlements.csv – Age-wise settlement percentages

### Dimensional model:

•	dim_customer → fact_premiums (1:many)
•	dim_date → fact_premiums (1:many)
•	dim_policies → fact_premiums (1:many)
•	dim_age (created in Power Query) → dim_customer (1:many)

### 🔎 Insights

•	Revenue contribution is concentrated within specific age groups (31-40) and cities (Delhi NCR), indicating clear high-value customer segments.
•	Monthly growth trends reveal periodic spikes and slowdowns, suggesting the influence of seasonality and campaign timing.
•	Positive MoM growth in revenue outpaces customer growth in certain periods, indicating improved customer value rather than pure volume expansion.

### 💡 Recommendations

1.	Prioritize high-revenue age groups and cities for retention and upsell initiatives.
2.	Improve monetization in high-customer but low-revenue regions through pricing and cross-sell strategies.
3.	Track MoM trends to assess growth consistency and campaign effectiveness.

### 🔎 Insights

•	Sales mode preference is similar across age group.
•	Policy preferences are similar across all age-group.
•	Aligning product, channel, and engagement strategies by age group can significantly improve acquisition efficiency and customer lifetime value.

### 💡 Recommendations
1.	Align sales modes with age-specific preferences to improve acquisition efficiency.
2.	Customize policy offerings based on dominant preferences within each age segment.
  
With these strategies, we can improve acquisition in low-performing segments and enhance profitability of high-contributing age groups.

## 🧮 Important DAX Measures

Total Customers =
DISTINCTCOUNT(fact_premiums[customer_code])

Total Revenue =
SUM(fact_premiums[final_premium_amt(INR)])

Average Daily Revenue = 
AVERAGEX (
    FILTER (
        VALUES ( dim_date[date] ),
        NOT ISBLANK ( [Total Revenue] )
    ),
    [Total Revenue]
)

Avg Daily Customer = 
AVERAGEX (
    VALUES ( dim_date[date] ),
    [Total Customers]
)
